  The project Life, Still was born within the Archivio Atena artistic residency realized in the town of Atena Lucana (SA). 
  <br>
  <br>
  Life, Still is configured as a catalogue of the rooms and the objects present inside a single house located in the historic town center, Casa Italia, as it is affectionately called by the inhabitants. However, it is not just a regular house: although it has been uninhabited for more than two years now, the house seems to retain a vitality of its own, both thanks to the numerous objects, preserved unaltered, that are still inside of it and to the immaculate state of preservation of the rooms. The house is meticulously catalogued the through the individual objects that make up the rooms in a more neutral way using a single frontal point of view so as to suspend them in time and space, making them identifiable by all as objects belonging to a common memory. The rooms, on the other hand, were documented differently through an almost oblique shot returning the feeling of a house still inhabited and pulsating with life. 
  <br>
  <br> Souvenir photos, furnishing, kitchen utensils, but also keys, documents, medicines and small objects become a personal, collective and social biography that recaptures habits, desires and memories.
